# JavaScript-Quiz


Quiz for javascript

I've make 3 files, index.html, for basic HTML and CSS code

script.js where  i do javaScript coding . every function happening in a page has been placed in 
seprate function for easy access and debugging.

and questions.js (where i saved all questions their options and answer)

 when you go on main page click on start quiz button to start the quiz. as soon as you press start button
 coundown start at the rightside of the page. every question have 10 sec to answer. and if u press the wrong answer 5 sec would be takeout from the remaning time.

 All the choices button and headings are appended dynamically in java script.
 when you choose your choices the result is shown on the bottom of the screen. which teels you if your answer is right or wrong.

 After finishing your quiz the final page shows you the final score and a button which gives you the option to start again.
 I've used click events on the buttons to perform different functions.
